## Allowing Browser to Download Multiple Files

By default, browsers may restrict downloading multiple files at once for security reasons. You may need to adjust your browser settings to allow multiple files download:

- **Google Chrome**: Go to Settings -> Privacy and security -> Site Settings -> Additional content settings -> Automatic downloads, and switch the toggle to 'On'.

- **Firefox**: Go to Options -> Privacy & Security -> Permissions -> Settings for Blocking New Windows and Pop-ups, uncheck the box for 'Block pop-up windows'.

Please note that the settings might vary based on the version of your browser.
